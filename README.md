Welcome to the new era of **RenuxOS**.

Iâ€™m Renan Lucas, the creator of RenuxOS. After a lot of exploration using Rust in the early stages of the project, I decided to take RenuxOS into a new, lighter, and more focused phase â€” with a full rewrite of the kernel in **Zig**.

This marks the beginning of a redesigned system built for clarity, modularity, and hacker-level control.

## ðŸ“Œ What is RenuxOS?

**RenuxOS** is a hobbyist operating system designed to be:
- Hybrid kernel (mixing micro and monolithic features)
- Modular and customizable
- Written mainly in **Zig**, with parts in C and Assembly
- Fully built from scratch using a monolithic repository structure

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Why rewrite it in Zig?

Rust is a powerful language, but for a low-level OS project like this, it became too heavy for my current flow. As someone whoâ€™s neurodivergent (AuDHD), I realized Zig offers me:
- Fewer distractions from complex compiler errors
- A cleaner and more predictable mental model
- Direct integration with C and assembly
- No dependency on Cargo or external build systems

This doesn't mean Rust is bad â€” it just means Zig fits **better** for the future of this project.

## ðŸ”§ Project Status

This is a **complete reboot** of the original `renuxos-src` repository. If you're looking for the old Rust-based version, it's been archived here:
