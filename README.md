## 🌀 A New Era for RenuxOS

Hi, I'm **Renan Lucas**, the creator of RenuxOS.

After a long prototyping and exploration phase with **Rust**, I decided to take RenuxOS in a **lighter, sharper, and more personal direction**. This marked the beginning of a complete rewrite of the kernel (and the first real release!) in [**Zig**](https://ziglang.org/).

This is the true beginning of a system built on the pillars of **clarity, modularity, and hacker-level control** — starting with our first official version: **Aurora**.

---

## 🎯 Core Principles

**RenuxOS** is an operating system crafted by a neurodivergent mind, for enthusiasts and hackers, with the following goals:

-  [x] *partial* 🧠 **Hybrid Kernel:** To combine the security and modularity of a microkernel with the performance of a monolithic kernel.
-  [x] 🧩 **Extreme Modularity:** Allowing every component of the system to be easily replaced or customized.
- [x] 🛠️ **Built with the Right Tools:** Written primarily in **Zig**, with parts in **C** and **Assembly** where needed, for maximum control and simplicity.
-  [x] 🗂️ **Monorepo:** The entire source code lives in a single repository (`renuxos-src`) to simplify building, development, and collaboration.

### Why Zig?

While Rust is a fantastic language, it proved to be overly complex and heavy for my creative workflow. As someone with **AuDHD (Autism + ADHD)**, the simplicity and predictability of Zig align perfectly with how I think and code.

> **Zig just fits my brain better.**
> And that's exactly what RenuxOS needs to thrive.

-   🧘‍♂️ **Less Noise:** Direct and straightforward compiler errors without unnecessary complexity.
-   💡 **Clean Mental Model:** The language's clarity makes development more intuitive.
-   🔩 **Natural Integration:** Seamless interoperability with **C** and **Assembly**.
-   📦 **Integrated Build System:** No more external build systems. Just `zig build`, and you're done.
