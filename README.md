# 🚀 Welcome to the new era of **RenuxOS**

I’m **Renan Lucas**, the creator of RenuxOS.  
After a lot of exploration using **Rust** in the early prototype phase, I’ve decided to take RenuxOS into a **new, lighter, and sharper direction** — with a full rewrite (and first real release!) of the kernel in [**Zig**](https://ziglang.org/).

This marks the true beginning of a system built for **clarity**, **modularity**, and **hacker-level control** — starting with our very first official version: **Aurora**.

---

## 📌 What is RenuxOS?

**RenuxOS** is a neurodivergent-crafted, hacker-focused operating system designed to be:

- 🧠 A **hybrid kernel**, blending microkernel and monolithic features
- 🧩 **Modular and customizable** down to the core
- 🛠️ Written mainly in **Zig**, with pieces in **C** and **Assembly**
- 🗂️ Built from scratch using a **monolithic repository** (`renuxos-src`) to simplify development

---

## 🎯 Why rewrite it in Zig?

While **Rust** is a powerful language, it turned out to be overkill and too heavy for my creative and neurodivergent workflow.  
As someone with **AuDHD (Autism + ADHD)**, I found that **Zig** just clicks better with how I think and code:

- 🧘‍♂️ Less noise from over-complicated compiler errors
- 💡 A cleaner, more predictable mental model
- 🔩 Natural integration with **C** and **Assembly**
- 📦 No external build systems — just `zig build`, and done

> Zig fits my brain better — and that’s exactly what RenuxOS needs to grow.

## 🌈 What's Next?

This is just the beginning.

RenuxOS is my playground — but also a mission: to prove that people who think differently can build **different systems**.  
I’m not just building an OS, I’m building a vision for hacker freedom, clarity in architecture, and accessibility in complexity.

> Whether you’re neurodivergent, low-level curious, or just love weird cool projects — welcome to the **RenuxOS journey**. 🌀

Stay tuned for dev logs, boot demos, docs and more.  
Stars, forks, and feedback are super appreciated. ⭐

🛠 Built with `zig build` and a lot of love,
